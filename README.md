### Hello! 👋
My name is Sean O'Gary. I am an aspiring software engineer (and perhaps designer? probably should be...). I love programming for the web, playing chess and Go, reading about math / physics, and listening to and *attempting* to write music. 

🙏 looking for a job! \
🚀 learning full time! \
📖 **currently reading**: Refactoring: Improving Existing Code (great book) \
🗨️ ask me about my current project, P2P Chess (better name forthcoming) \
⚡Fun Fact: I NEVER GIVE UP
